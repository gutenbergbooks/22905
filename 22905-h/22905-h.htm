<p>"Do the British people," asks Mr.
<span class="sc">Blatchford</span>, "understand the nature
of the monster modern military science
has created?" We hope to hear later
what name Mr. <span class="sc">Winston Churchill</span>
has found for Mr. <span class="sc">Blatchford</span>.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Agitation for a Federal Divorce Law
is being revived in the United States.
It appears that there are still some
backward States where the expenses
of a divorce suit mount up to something
like ten dollars and the parties
often have to wait as long as three
weeks before the knot is untied.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>"It has now been decided definitely,"
says <i>The Daily Express</i>,
"that Sir <span class="sc">Auckland
Geddes</span> will leave England
on April 10th." This
disposes finally of the
rumour that he intended
taking it with him.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The natives of the Andaman
Islands average
about seventy pounds each
in weight. They are so
short in stature that their
feet only just reach the
ground in time.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p><span class="sc">M. Loucheur</span> suggests
that France should build
houses similar to those
which are not being built
in England.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>"Sergeant R. Pernotte,"
says a student of human
endeavour, "last week
punched a ball for fifty
hours without a break." It is presumed
that the ball must have done
something to annoy him.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Thirty thousand years ago, says a
weekly journal, the seas around England
were at a higher level than at present.
It is difficult to know what can be
done about it, but it is just as well that
the matter should be mentioned.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>According to Mr. <span class="sc">M. T. Simm, M.P.</span>,
there are many wayside inns of a passable
nature. The trouble, of course, is
that so many people have a difficulty in
passing them.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>We understand that Mr. Justice &mdash;&mdash;'s
question, "Who is Mr. <span class="sc">Lloyd George</span>?"
has been postponed to a date to be
fixed later.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>A trade journal advertises a new
calculating machine which will total up
stupendous figures without any human
help at all. A correspondent writes to
say that in his house he has the identical
gas meter which gave the inventor
his idea.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The contemporary which refers to the
discovery of a gold ring inside a cod-fish
as extraordinary evidently cannot
be aware that many profiteers who go
in for fishing are nowadays using such
articles as bait.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>A purse containing nearly a hundred
pounds in treasury notes, picked up by
a policeman in South Wales, has not
yet been claimed. It is now thought
probable that a local miner may have
dropped his week's wages whilst entering
his car and that his secretary has
not yet called his attention to the
deficit.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>"The way some newsboys dodge in
and out of the moving traffic is most
dangerous and a serious accident is
sure to result before very long," complains
a writer in an evening paper.
For ourselves we cannot but admire
this attempt on the boys' part to make
history while in the act of selling it.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>We learn from an evening paper that
a large woollen warehouse in London
was completely destroyed by fire the
other day. We cannot understand why
some people use such inflammable
material for building purposes.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>An old pleasure-boat proprietor at
Yarmouth has stated in an interview
that, although all his skiffs and dinghies
are ten to fifteen years old, they are
much more trustworthy than those
being built at the present time. We
await, fearfully, the comments of Lord
<span class="sc">Fisher</span>.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Dutch wasps, says a news item, are
very much like British. Only the finished
expert can tell the difference on
being stung.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>It is said that the Dutch are the most
religious race of to-day. Of course it
is well known that the Chinese pray
more than the Dutch, but then nobody
understands what they are saying.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The Ascot Fire Brigade went on
strike last week and several important
fires had to be postponed at the last
moment.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The Bolsheviks, it appears,
may not, after all,
be as black as they are
painted. It is reported
that <span class="sc">Trotsky</span> has caused
one of his Chinese guards
to be executed for calling
another an Irishman.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Senator <span class="sc">Borah</span> recently
informed the American
Press that the Presidential
election campaign was
becoming a Saturnalia of
public corruption. In one
flagrant case it appears
that a man who was given
the money to buy ten
dollars' worth of Irish
Republic went and bought
a box of cigars instead.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>"To keep cats off the
seed beds," says <i>Home
Chat</i>, "bury a small bottle up to the
neck and fill it with liquid ammonia."
The old practice of burying the cat up
to the neck in the seed bedding and
keeping the ammonia for subsequent
use is considered obsolete.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>During the past year in London 2,886
persons were knocked down by horsed
vehicles, as compared with 8,388 who
were knocked down by motor vehicles.
The popularity of the latter, it seems,
is still unchallenged.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>A weekly paper has an article on
"Bad Manners Among Fish." We have
ourselves noticed a tendency to ignore
the old adage that fish, like little
children, should be seen and not heard.</p>

<h2>POSSESSION.</h2>

<p>The dear old home has been let to
strangers. An interloper occupies the
messuage. A foreign master controls
the demesne.</p>

<p>To-day especially, when as I write
the air is balmy and the skies are blue,
it is agonising to feel that our own
spring rhubarb is growing crimson only
to be toyed with by alien lips, and that
the thrush on our pear-tree bough&mdash;&mdash;But
no, I am wrong; the pear-tree
bough is in the garden of No. 9; it is
only the trunk that stands in the garden
of No. 10. That, by the way, is an accident
that frequently occurs to estate-owners.
Consider critically for a moment
those well-known lines in which
<span class="sc">Browning</span> says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"Hark where my blossom'd pear-tree in the hedge</p>
<p>Leans to the field,"</p>
</div></div>

<p>and then goes on to speak of "the
wise thrush" on "the bent spray's edge"
as "singing his song twice over." It
is pretty obvious that the reason the
poet assigns to this action on the bird's
part is not the correct one. Evidently
the part of the tree on which it was sitting
was on the other side of the hedge
in the next-door fellow's garden, and
it was conscientiously trying to allot
one performance to each of the two
rival householders. But I seem to
have wandered a little from the ancient
home.</p>

<p>Come with me in imagination, reader,
and let us have a look at it together.
The fourth house to the left in this
winding road that fringes the common,
you see it standing there gazing a little
wistfully, yet with a quiet air of semi-detachment,
out over the wide expanse
of green. Half right and half left are
two monstrous blocks of red brick flats
overlooking it with a thousand envious
eyes. The middle distance is dotted
pleasantly with hawthorn bushes and
the pretty pieces of sandwich-paper
that are always the harbingers of London's
Spring. Beyond these things,
and far away to the front, you may
detect on clear days a white church-tower
nestling like Swiss milk amongst
immemorial trees. And this view is
mine&mdash;mine, like the old home. If we
linger for a moment in the road we
shall probably see the scornful face of
the proud usurper at one of the windows
calmly enjoying this view of mine,
all unconscious that I, the rightful
owner, am standing beneath. Does it
not remind you of the films?&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Charles Carruthers</i>, an outcast from
his ancestral halls, eyes mournfully
the scene of merry junketing within.
<i>Charles Carruthers</i>&mdash;<i>blick! blick!</i>"&mdash;and
you see him eyeing mournfully
outside&mdash;"<i>blick! blick!</i>"&mdash;and you
see the junketers eating his junket
within.</p>

<p>On looking back in a calmer mood
on the lines which I have just written,
I feel it possible that I may have let
my emotions run away with me and
conveyed a slightly false impression. I
may have suggested that the old home
has belonged to my family since Domesday
Book or dear-knows-when or some
other historic date in our island story.
That would not be strictly true. As a
matter of fact I have never lived in the
house, nor have any of my relations
either. It has belonged to me, to be
quite accurate, since March 25th, 1920,
and the interloper was interloping on
a short lease when I bought the long
lease over his head. It is also true
that by an awkward and absurd convention
I have to restore the old home
to the ground landlord in 1941. But
who cares about what is going to
happen in 1941? The Coalition may
have come to an end by that time, and
the first Labour Government, under
Lord <span class="sc">Northcliffe</span> or Mr. <span class="sc">Jack Jones</span>,
may be in power. Some bricklayer, in
a mood of artistic frenzy, may have designed
the plan of a new brick and had
it passed by the Ministry of Housing.
<span class="sc">Dempsey</span> may have met <span class="sc">Carpentier</span>.</p>

<p>No, the trouble is about the interloper.
It appears that, having the
remainder of a lease to run, he can go
on anteloping (you know what I mean)
for two years more if he likes. To do
him justice he admits that the place is
mine and wants to leave it. He has
no real love for the priceless old spot.
All that he asks is somewhere better to
go to. So I am gladly doing my best
to help him. I send him notices of
forty-roomed Tudor mansions, which
seem to abound in the market, mansions
with timbered parks, ornamental
waters, Grecian temples, ha-has, gazebos,
herds of graceful bounding gazebos,
and immediate possession. I do more
than this. I send him extravagant
eulogies of lands across the seas, where
the grapes grow larger, the pear-trees
blossom all the year round and separate
thrushes laid on to each estate never
cease to sing. I suggest the advantages
of the mercantile marine and a
life on the rolling main, of big game
shooting, polar exploration, and the
residential attractions of Constantinople,
Berlin, Dublin and Vladivostok.</p>

<p>Concurrently with this I try hard to
cultivate in him a certain distaste for
the dear old home. I walk up and
down the road in front of it with a pair
of field-glasses, and, if I see that a little
chip has fallen off anywhere or the
paint on the gate has been scratched,
I call on him at once.</p>

<p>"I happened to be passing the
demesne," I say, "when I noticed a
rather serious item of dilapidation," or
"A word with you about the messuage;
it looks a trifle off colour to-day.
Have you had it blistered lately?" And
this worries him a good deal, because
he is responsible for all repairs.</p>

<p>I do not fail to point out to my
friends, either, that this is my well-known
family seat, and I persuade
them from time to time to go and ask
for me at the door. "What, isn't he
living here <i>yet</i>?" I get them to say,
with a well-feigned surprise. "It is
his house, isn't it?" I frequently have
letters addressed to myself sent there,
and every morning and afternoon the
nurse takes the children past it for a
walk. The children are well drilled.</p>

<p>"Look, Priscilla, that's our garden,"
says Richard in a high penetrating
treble; and</p>

<p>"There's a darlin' little buttercup.
I want to go in," Priscilla replies.</p>

<p>All this quiet steady pressure is
bound to have its due effect in time.
Gradually I think he will begin to feel
that a shadow haunts the ancestral
halls (the front one, you know, and the
back passage), that a footstep not his
own treads behind him on the stair,
that the dear old home will never be
happy until it is occupied by its rightful
lord.</p>

<p>I shall send him a marked copy of
this article.</p>

<h2>TOOLS OF TRADE.</h2>

<p>I am sorry for the man who took his
typewriter on the Underground and was
made to buy a bicycle-ticket for it. But
I have no doubt he deserved it. I am
sure that he did it in spiritual pride.
He was trying to make himself equal
to the manual labourer who carries
large bags of tools on the Tube and
sighs heavily as he lays them on your
foot. I am sure that he was tired of
being scornfully regarded by manual
labourers, and was determined to make
it quite clear that he too had done, or
was about to do, a day's labour, and
manual labour at that. It was a sinful
motive and it deserved to be punished;
but it was natural. Nowadays we all
feel like that. We caught it from the
War, when the great thing was to show
that you were doing more work than
anybody else.</p>

<p>I take from a recent copy of <a name="hansard"><i>Hansard</i></a><a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
the following brisk and delicate piece
of dialogue:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mr. <span class="sc">Macquisten</span>: You Labour men
have forgotten what sweat is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">W. Thorne</span>: I have never seen
many lawyers sweat, anyhow.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">Speaker</span>: This discussion is becoming
intemperate.</p>

<p><span class="sc">An Hon. Member</span>: The Hon. Member
for Springburn never sweated in his life.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">Macquisten</span>: Yes, I have laboured
in the docks."</p>

<p>That is it, you see. Sweating is the
great criterion of usefulness to-day. If
you cannot show that you have sweated
in the past, you must at least show
that you are sweating now, or have
every intention of sweating in a moment
or two. Personally, as a private
secretary, I find it very difficult, though
I do my best. As a private secretary I
labour in a rich house in the notoriously
idle neighbourhood of South Kensington,
where nobody would believe
that anybody laboured, much less perspired
over it. So when I pass, on
the way to my rich house, a builder's
labourer or a milkman or a dustman, I
have to exhibit as clearly as I can all
the signs of a harsh employment and
industrial fatigue. I take great pains
about this; I walk much faster; I frown
heavily and I look as pale as possible.
In the Tube I close my eyes. I hope
all this is effective, but as far as I can
see the milkman never looks at me,
and the builder is always saying to
another builder, "'E says to me, 'Wot
abaht it?' 'e says, and I says to 'im,
'Yus, wot abaht it?' I says." But it is
worth the effort.</p>

<p>Well, that is why that poor man was
carrying a typewriter. I wonder why
everybody else in the Tube carries an
"attach&eacute;-case." It has been calculated
that if all the attach&eacute;-cases which get
on to the train at Hammersmith at
9 <span class="sc">a.m.</span> were left on the platform, six
men or twelve women or three horses
could take their place in every car.
That means about ninety more men or
one-hundred-and-eighty more women
or forty-five more horses could leave
Hammersmith between 9 <span class="sc">a.m.</span> and 9.30.
So that if attach&eacute;-cases were forbidden
the traffic problem would be practically
solved.</p>

<p>Why shouldn't they be forbidden?
It depends, of course, on what is inside
the cases; and nobody knows that for
certain. But one can guess. I have
been guessing for a long time. At first
I thought they were full of very confidential
papers. In the old days the
attach&eacute;-case was the peculiar trademark
of private secretaries and diplomats
and high-up people like that.
Even attach&eacute;s carried them sometimes.
The very lowest a man with an attach&eacute;-case
could be was a First-Class Civil
Servant; and one was justified in
imagining confidential papers inside, or,
at any rate, home-work of the first
importance. But nowadays there are
too many of them for that. The
attach&eacute;-case has been degraded; it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page252" id="page252"></a>[pg 252]</span>universal. This might be because there
is practically no male person alive just
now who has not been an adjutant at
one time or another, and pinched at
least one attach&eacute;-case from the orderly-room.
But most of the cases in the
Tube are carried by females, so that
theory is no good.</p>

<p>Well, then, I imagined sandwiches
or knitting or powder-puffs or tea;
but those also are rotten hypotheses.
I have too much faith in the good sense
of my fellow-countrywomen to believe
that they would cart a horrible thing
like a cheap attach&eacute;-case about simply
in order to convey a sandwich or a
powder-puff from one end of London
to the other. So I had to fall back on
my own experience.</p>

<p>I know, at any rate, what is inside
mine. There are some rather grubby
envelopes which I borrowed from the
House of Commons, and some very
grubby blotting-paper from the same
source, and either a ream of foolscap
or a quire of foolscap, whichever is
which; some pipe-cleaners and a few
pieces of milk-chocolate; and a letter
from the Amalgamated Association of
Fish-Friers which ought to have been
answered a long time ago; and a memorandum
on Hog-Importing which I am
always going to read while waiting at the
station; and a nice piece of thick string
with which I have tied a bowline on
a bight; and two broken pencils and
some more envelopes; and a Parliamentary
Whip of last year and a
stationery bill of the year before; and
several bills of my employer, not to
mention a cheque for ninety-seven
pounds which I suppose he would like
me to send to the bank; and a great
deal of fluff and a pipe or two and four
or five stamped letters which it is now
too late to post. That is all there is in
my case.</p>

<p>But I carry it backwards and forwards,
in and out, to and fro, day after
day; and the only time it is ever
opened at either end of the journey is
when, in addition to the articles previously
mentioned, it contains bottles.
But I do not carry it for the sake of
bottles; far from it. I am one of those
men who do not mind going about with
a comparatively naked bottle. I carry
it simply because it is the tool of my
trade, and because, if you don't carry a
tool of some kind on the Underground,
at any moment you may be taken for
an idle rich, if not actually a parasite,
who never sweated in his life.</p>

<p>And that, I am persuaded, is why
everybody else carries theirs.</p>

<p>But this is a very serious conclusion.
It will be a terrible thing if everyone
is going to carry the tools of his trade
about with him to show that he has a
trade; the barrister his briefs, the
doctor his stethoscope or his shiny
black bag; the butcher his chopper;
the dentist&mdash;but no, we cannot have
that. There must be other ways. We
might wear badges, as we did in the
War, only they would be office badges
and trade badges, instead of regimental
badges or discharged badges. Then
we should have again the dear old war-game
of trying to read what was on
them without being rude. That is what
one really misses in public places in
these days of Peace&mdash;that and the
uniforms.</p>

<p>It was easy to make conversation in
a restaurant in the old days, when
people kept on coming in in curious
uniforms, and the ladies wondered
what they were and the men pretended
they knew all about them. But all
that is dead now, and I think these
sweat-badges would supply a serious
want.</p>

<p>But what will the author wear?
And who will believe that he ever
breaks into beads of perspiration at his
labour?</p>

<h2>ETIQUETTE FOR FIRES.</h2>

<p>It seems that Mr. <span class="sc">A. R. Dyer</span>, the Chief Officer of the
London Fire Brigade, has issued a booklet giving hints
on fire protection and also how to call the Fire Brigade.
We have pleasure in giving a few points which we are
sure are not included in this interesting and useful publication.</p>

<hr />

<p>Before sending for the Fire Brigade it is advisable to
make quite sure that you have a fire in the house to offer
them. But do not adopt the old plan of waiting until it
reaches the second-floor. This is rather apt to discolour
the wall-paper.</p>

<hr />

<p>Above all the householder who intends to have a fire in
his house must keep calm. Immediately the maid rushes
into the room to say that the kitchen is on fire, place the
book you are reading on the table, remove your slippers
and put on a thick pair of heavy boots and a Harris tweed
shooting coat. Your next duty is to call the Fire Brigade,
and not to meddle with the fire yourself, for very often an
amateur completely spoils a fire before the Brigade arrives.</p>

<hr />

<p>When you see the Brigade engine dashing along the
road don't stop it and offer to show the driver a short cut.
And when they start work do not worry the firemen by
telling them how to do it better. After all, while it may be
your house, it is their fire.</p>

<h2>PARTY TACTICS.</h2>

<p>It began with my reading an article
on "How to be a Success at an Evening
Party." I was rather surprised to
know that, for one thing, some knowledge
of Spiritualism is necessary to
enable one to be a popular entertainer
nowadays. It has never struck me
before that spiritualists were such a
genial class, full of <i>bonhomie</i> and great
joy; but then, although I read the
Sunday papers, I'm afraid I don't know
enough about the subject.</p>

<p>Even if we haven't got the rollicking
boisterous temperament of the
born spiritualist, however, there are, it
seems, other ways of winning a mild
popularity. "If you confess to only a
slight knowledge of palmistry," the
article continued, "it is often enough
to make you the centre of interest at
once."</p>

<p>This appealed to me strongly. I like
to be the centre of interest. So I
bought a handbook on palmistry and,
having absorbed it, set out for my
next party full of confidence.</p>

<p>Surely enough, the first thing I saw
on arrival was a dank-looking man holding
forth on Spiritualism, and enjoying
what I should call a chastened vogue
with most of the company gathered
about him.</p>

<p>I took up my position on the fringe
of the group. "Talking of psychics,
the occult and all that sort of thing,"
I remarked carelessly, "isn't cheiromancy
an interesting study?"</p>

<p>"Nasty sort of study, I should call
it," murmured one of the company, evidently
under a vague impression that it
had something to do with feet. My
hostess looked up sharply. "Cheiromancy,"
she repeated; "can you read
the hand?"</p>

<p>"Only a little," I confessed modestly.
"Just enough to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>I don't quite know how it happened.
There was a sort of flank and rear
movement and the entire company, excepting,
of course, the dank spiritualist,
precipitated itself on me. Voices clamoured
for me to foretell destinies. Hands
were thrust before me. They eddied,
surged and swirled about me. I never
saw such a massed quantity of hands.
It was like leaving a Swiss hotel in the
height of the season.</p>

<p>"One at a time, please," I said limply.</p>

<p>I seized a palm, followed it up, and
found that it belonged to a pinched
sour-looking female. Her character
was stamped on her face as well as on
her hand. If, however, I had said to
her, "Yours is a flaccid repressed disposition
you have a lack of imagination
and a total absence of humour;
your life is too narrow and self-centred
to be of the least interest to anyone,"
she might not have liked it. You see,
with even a slight knowledge of palmistry
you soon find out when reading
hands that it's no use telling people the
truth. They want a version which I
can only describe as "garbled."</p>

<p>Accordingly I bent over the repressed
female's hand with an air of profundity
and said, "There being a total absence
of the mounts of Mercury and the Sun,
a calm and even nature is indicated."
(You're nearly always safe in saying
this.) "Your sense of order and of the
fitness of things would not allow you to
see any fun in the joke of, say, pulling
away a chair from anyone about to sit
down. In fact you would not see a
joke in anything&mdash;like that," I added
hastily, and gave her hand back, feeling
I had made the best of a bad job.</p>

<p>But she still lingered.</p>

<p>"Does it show if I shall&mdash;&mdash;?" She
paused in embarrassment.</p>

<p>"Get married?" I asked, knowing
human nature better than palmistry.</p>

<p>She looked so fiercely eager, with
such a vivid light of hope in her eye,
that I decided to award her a husband
on the spot.</p>

<p>"The Hepatica line, being allied to the
line of Fate," I said impressively "signifies
that you will marry&mdash;late in life."</p>

<p>The press around me at once grew
terrific. All the girls said, "Tell me if
I'm going to get married;" and all the
men remarked, "Of course it's utter
rubbish," and were more eager about
it than the girls. I became reckless.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page256" id="page256"></a>[pg 256]</span>I worked my way steadily through the
crowd, doling out husbands with an unsparing
hand. And it was just when I
was beginning to feel a little tired of
the game that my enemy was delivered
into my hands.</p>

<p>We were not on visiting or even
speaking terms; we were indeed the
most implacable foes. But that did
not prevent the woman from shamelessly
thrusting herself before me and
saying gushingly, "Do tell me what
you see in my hand."</p>

<p>I looked at her, and before my searching
glance even her brazen face fell.
Six months previously that creature
had stolen Wilkins, the best cook I ever
had. Mere man may not understand
the enormity of this offence; but every
woman knows there is no crime more
heinous, more despicable, more unforgivable.
She might find it in her heart
to condone larceny, think lightly of
arson, or even excuse murder; but there
is not one who would extend even a
deathbed pardon to the person who had
robbed her of a treasured servant.</p>

<p>And Wilkins had been a treasure indeed.
It brought the tears to my
eyes when I thought of her exquisite
<i>omelettes aux rognons</i>, her salads, her
<i>poularde &agrave; la gel&eacute;e</i>, her wide diversity
of knowledge regarding <i>entr&eacute;es</i> and savouries.
With a hard and bitter smile
I settled down to interpret the hand of
the woman before me.</p>

<p>The company gathered closer round
us and I noticed that Mrs. B., the particular
friend of my enemy, bent affectionately
over her with truly feminine
expectation of "revelations." And from
under the scarf which my enemy wore
about her arms and shoulders she
seemed, I thought, to project her hand
rather timidly. Perhaps she realised
too late what was in store for her.</p>

<p>I was quite dignified about it; I want
you to understand that. Many another,
seeing that creature so plump and well-fed
and knowing the reason, would have
broken out into vituperation. But my
tactics were more subtle. My manner,
as I studied her palm, was at first
nonchalant, even urbane. Then I gave
a start and faltered, "I&mdash;I suppose you
wish me to tell you the truth?"</p>

<p>A frightened look came into her eyes
which, I noted with satisfaction, were
beginning to show tinges of yellow
(Wilkins' only fault is that in some of
her dishes she is over-liberal with the
salad oil and high seasonings). "Of
course I want to know the truth," said
my victim faintly.</p>

<p>With an apparent air of diffidence I
began my recital. I did not spare her
in the smallest degree. I ascribed to
her all those sinister characteristics I
had read about in the handbook; and,
when I suddenly remembered a delicious
<i>vol-au-vent</i> upon which I had doted,
I added a few of my own.</p>

<p>It was a terrible indictment. When
I had finished an awed silence fell
upon the gathering. Everybody waited
breathlessly for the victim to speak.</p>

<p>"That was most interesting," she
said with a sinister laugh. "But perhaps
you will read <i>my</i> palm now. You
see, it was Mrs. B.'s that you have just
read. She slipped her hand through
under my scarf."</p>

<p>There was a burst of laughter from
everybody. Idiotic kind of joke, I call it.</p>

<p>I can assure the writer of the Sunday
articles that a knowledge of palmistry
does not necessarily make one popular.</p>

<p>I am now wondering where you can
buy hand-books on spiritualism.</p>

<h2>THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS UNION.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">An appeal to all men of good will.</span></p>

<p>The League of Nations Union is engaged in a campaign
for the purpose of making the objects of the League of
Nations better understood in the country at large. The
chief danger that threatens the League is to be found in
the apathy or unconsidered scepticism of the public; almost
the sole active opposition comes from those who would
substitute for it a proletarian Internationale devoted to the
interests of one class only in the world, and from certain reactionaries
who favour a return to the system of imperialism
which was the cause of the War. In the words of <span class="sc">His
Majesty the King</span>, "We fought to gain a lasting Peace
and it is our supreme duty to take every measure to secure
it. For that nothing is more essential than a strong and
enduring League of Nations. The Covenant of Paris is a
good foundation, well and truly laid. But it is and can be
no more than a foundation. The nature and strength of
the structure to be built upon it must depend on the
earnestness and sincerity of popular support."</p>

<p>To those, if any, who contend that the Government should
be left to carry out its own propaganda for the League of
Nations the obvious answer is that it is necessary for this
work to be done by an independent body which can bring
public pressure to bear upon the Government of the day
and urge such amendments in the machinery and constitution
of the League as time and experience may show to
be desirable. The Union, in fact, bears to the League of
Nations the same relation that the Navy League bears to
the Senior Service; it is an independent body organised to
educate opinion in the needs of a national cause.</p>

<p>Since its inception in January of this year the activities
of the League have covered a wide range, which embraces
organisation for the administering of territory under its
trusteeship, and for the consideration of international
questions relating to transit, finance, labour and health.
America's repudiation (only temporary, it may be hoped)
of the pledges of her own President, the original and chief
advocate of the League of Nations, has meanwhile thrown
upon Great Britain the main burden of responsibility in
the Councils of the League, a fact that constitutes an overwhelming
claim upon the patriotism of British citizens.
The duty of bringing this claim home to the public has been
taken up by the League of Nations Union, under the Presidency
of Lord <span class="sc">Grey of Fallodon</span>. It has already established
a headquarters and a staff of experts; organised hundreds
of meetings throughout the country, and inaugurated
nearly two hundred branches. It publishes two periodicals
and many pamphlets and is preparing educational text-books;
it is taking part in an international conference with similar
voluntary societies in other countries.</p>

<p>Clearly such work cannot be carried on without generous
support. The sum for which the League of Nations Union
appeals&mdash;a million pounds&mdash;may sound large, but it represents
only the cost of four hours of the War, and is not
much to ask as an insurance against another and yet more
terrible war.</p>

<p>Mr. Punch very earnestly begs his readers to send contributions
in aid of this great and necessary work to the
Hon. Treasurer of the Fund (Sir <span class="sc">Brien Cokayne</span>, late
Governor of the Bank of England), addressed to <span class="sc">The

<p><i>Monday, March 29th.</i>&mdash;During a brief
sitting the Lords got through a good
deal of business. The Silver Coinage
Bill awakened Lord <span class="sc">Chaplin's</span> reminiscences
of his bimetallic days, when he
was accused by Sir <span class="sc">William Harcourt</span>
of trying to stir up mutiny in India.
Undeterred by this warning, however,
the Peers gave a Second Reading to
the measure and also to the Coal Mines
Emergency Bill, which is less
up-to-date than it sounds,
and deals not with the present
emergency but with the last
emergency but one. They
also passed the Importation
of Plumage Bill, at the instance
of Lord <span class="sc">Aberdeen</span>, who
pleaded that beautiful birds,
"the result of myriads of
years of evolution," should
not be exterminated to make
a British matron's picture-hat.</p>

<p>A few noble lords tore
themselves away from these
entrancing topics to attend
the opening of the debate in
the Commons on the Government
of Ireland Bill. They
were ill-rewarded for their
pains, for never has a Home
Rule debate produced fewer
interesting moments. The
<span class="sc">Chief Secretary</span> was so
studiously restrained in explaining
the merits of the Bill
that the "yawning chasm"
which, according to its opponents,
the measure is going
to create between Southern
and Northern Ireland was to
be observed in advance on the
countenances of many of his
listeners. Years ago Mr. <span class="sc">Balfour</span>
told the Irish Nationalists
that Great Britain was
not to be bored into acceptance
of Home Rule; but I
am beginning to doubt now
whether he was right. If the
Government get the Bill through it will
be due more to John Bull's weariness
of the eternal Irish Question than to
any enthusiastic belief in the merits of
this particular scheme. Hardly anyone
off the Treasury Bench had a good
word to say for it, but fortunately for
its chances their criticisms were often
mutually destructive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">Clynes</span> moved its rejection. From
his remark that Irish respect for the
law was destroyed in 1913, and that
the present Administration was regarded
as "the most abominable form
of government that had ever ruled in
Ireland," I should gather that he has
only recently begun his researches into
Irish history and Irish character, and is
working backwards. His prescription
was to cease governing Ireland by
force and leave her to frame her own
constitution.</p>

<p>Lord <span class="sc">Robert Cecil</span> agreed with Mr.
<span class="sc">Clynes</span> in regarding it as a very bad
Bill, but there parted company with
him. In his view the deterioration of
Ireland began in 1906, when the era of
"firm government" came to an end.
Drop coercion by all means, but "let
the murderers begin." As for forcing
self-government on a country that rejected
it, that was nonsense.</p>

<p>As "a citizen of the world," and
not merely an Irishman, Mr. <span class="sc">T. P.
O'Connor</span> denounced the Bill <i>urbi et
orbi</i>. Nobody in Ireland wanted it
unless it was the place-hunters of the
Bar and the Press, for whom it would
provide rich pickings.</p>

<p>The House was brought back from
rhetoric to plain fact by the <span class="sc">Chancellor
of the Exchequer's</span> reminder that if
the Bill were not passed the Home
Rule Act of 1914 would come into
force. He hoped that Southern Ireland
would recover its sanity, accept the Bill
and set itself to persuade Ulster into an
All-Ireland Parliament <i>vi&acirc;</i> the golden
bridge of the Irish Council.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="sc">Craig</span> could not imagine
that happening in his lifetime. To his
mind the only merit of the Bill was
that it safeguarded Ulster against
Dublin domination.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday, March 30th.</i>&mdash;Someone&mdash;I
suspect a midshipman&mdash;has been telling
Mr. <span class="sc">Bromfield</span> that five
British Admirals have been
sent to Vienna to supervise
the breaking up of the Austrian
Fleet, and that the said
Fleet now consists of three
motor-boats. He was much
relieved to hear from Mr.
<span class="sc">Harmsworth</span> that only one
Admiral had been sent, and
that the disposal of a Dreadnought,
several pre-Dreadnoughts
and sundry smaller
craft will give him plenty to do.</p>

<p>There appears to be a shortage
of ice in Hull. It is supposed
that the Member for the
Central Division (Lieut.-Commander
<span class="sc">Kenworthy</span>) has not
cut so much as he expected.</p>

<p>The debate on the Home
Rule Bill was resumed in a
much higher temperature
than that of yesterday. Mr.
<span class="sc">Asquith</span>, as he thundered in
carefully-polished phrases
against the "cumbrous, costly,
unworkable scheme," earned
many cheers from his followers,
and the even greater
tribute of interruptions from
his opponents. For a moment
he was pulled up, when to his
rhetorical question, "What
has Home Rule meant to us?"
some graceless Coalitionist
promptly answered, "Votes!"
but he soon got going again.
Ireland, he declared, was a
unit. The Bill gave her dualism
"with a shadowy background
of remote and potential unity."
The vaunted Council was "a fleshless
and bloodless skeleton." He remarked
upon "the sombre acquiescence of the
Ulstermen," and wondered why they
had accepted the Bill at all. "Because
we don't trust <i>you</i>," came the swift
reply from Sir <span class="sc">Edward Carson</span>.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">Asquith's</span> own remedy for Irish
unrest was to take the Act of 1914
and transform it into something like
Dominion Home Rule. Any county&mdash;Ulster
or Sinn Fein&mdash;that voted against
coming under the Dublin Parliament
should be left under the present administration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page260" id="page260"></a>[pg 260]</span>Mr. <span class="sc">Bonar Law</span> did not fail to point
out the inconsistency of condemning
the Government scheme for its complexity
and then immediately proposing
another which would involve not one
but a dozen partitions and make the
political map of Ireland look like a
crazy quilt. He advised the House to
reject Mr. <span class="sc">Asquith's</span> advice and pass
the Bill, even though it should have
the paradoxical result, for the moment,
of leaving Nationalist Ireland under
British administration while providing
Unionist Ulster with a Home Rule Parliament
for which it has never asked.</p>

<p>I suppose Mr. <span class="sc">Devlin</span> is not like the
Sinn Feiners, who, according to "T. P.,"
are so contemptuous of the Bill that
they have never read a line of it. Parts
of his speech, and particularly his
peroration, seemed far more suitable
to a Coercion Bill than to a measure
which is designed, however imperfectly,
to grant Home Rule to Ireland. The
Nationalist leader may be forgiven a
great deal, however, for his inimitable
description of Lord <span class="sc">Robert Cecil</span> as
"painfully struggling into the light
with one foot in the Middle Ages."</p>

<p><i>Wednesday, March 31st.</i>&mdash;The third
and last Act of the Home Rule drama
was the best. Nothing in the previous
two days' debate&mdash;not even Mr. <span class="sc">Bonar
Law's</span> ruthless analysis of the Paisley
policy for Ireland&mdash;gripped the audience
so intensely as Sir <span class="sc">Edward Carson's</span>
explanation of the Ulster attitude. He
declared that the Union had not failed
in Ulster, and would not have failed
anywhere if British politicians could
have refrained from bidding for Irish
votes. There was no alternative to it
but complete separation, and that was
what Home Rule would lead to. Ulster
did not want the Bill, and would not
vote for it; but, as the only alternative
was the Act of 1914, she was
prepared to accept it as a <i>pis aller</i>, and
to work her new Parliament for all it
was worth. At least it would enable her
to find schools for the thirty thousand
Belfast children now debarred from
education. More than that, he was
prepared to co-operate with any men
from Southern Ireland who were willing
to work <i>their</i> Parliament in a
similar spirit; and he paid a personal
tribute to Mr. <span class="sc">Devlin</span>, whose courage
he admired though he detested his
politics.</p>

<p>Thus there were gleams of hope even
in his otherwise gloomy outlook, as the
<span class="sc">Prime Minister</span> gladly acknowledged
in winding up the debate; and they
probably had some influence in swelling
the majority for the Bill, the figures
being 348 for the Second Reading, 94
against.</p>

<h2><i>POISSON D'AVRIL.</i></h2>

<p>For the tragedy of which I am about
to tell I consider that Brenda Scott is
entirely to blame. You shall judge.</p>

<p>There is a vacancy in my domestic
staff, and the rush to fill it has been
less enthusiastic than I could wish.
My housewifely heart leapt, therefore,
when, last Thursday morning, I espied
coming up the drive one whom I classed
at once as an applicant for the post of
housemaid. Nor was I deceived. She
gave the name of Eliza Smudge, and
said she came from my friend, Mrs.
Copplestone.</p>

<p>My suspicions were first aroused by her
extraordinary solicitude for my comfort.
"Outings" were entirely according to
my convenience. And when she added
that she liked to have plenty to do, and
that she always rose by 6 <span class="sc">a.m.</span>, I began
to look at her closely.</p>

<p>She wore a thick veil, and her eyes
were further obscured by large spectacles,
but I could discern a wisp of rather
artificial-looking hair drawn across her
forehead. And she was smiling.</p>

<p>Now why was she smiling? I could
certainly see nothing to smile at in
rising at six o'clock every morning.</p>

<p>"I shall be free on 5th of April,
ma'am," she was saying. "Let me see,
to-day is the 1st of April&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page261" id="page261"></a>[pg 261]</span><p>The 1st of April! It came to me then
in a flash&mdash;in one of those moments
of intuition of which even the mind of
the harassed housewife occasionally is
capable. It was Brenda Scott masquerading
as a housemaid!</p>

<p>Our conversation of a fortnight earlier
came back to me&mdash;Brenda's desire
to disguise herself and apply to Lady
Lupin for the post of kitchenmaid, her
confidence in her ability to carry it
off successfully, my ridicule of the
possibility that she could pass unrecognised.
So now, on the 1st of April,
she was for proving me wrong.</p>

<p>The disguise was certainly masterly.
Had it not been for that unaccountable
smile, and the hair&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>I did not lose my head. I continued
to carry on the conversation on orthodox
lines. Then I said, "Do you know
Miss Brenda Scott, who lives near
Mrs. Copplestone?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I've known her since she
was a little girl," was the answer.
"Sweet young lady she is."</p>

<p>"Ye&mdash;es," I said. "A little too fond
of practical jokes, perhaps."</p>

<p>The eyebrows went up almost to the
artificial-looking hair, which I had now
decided was horse-hair.</p>

<p>"Indeed," she said.</p>

<p>"Yes, my dear Brenda, it is your
besetting sin. You should pray against
it," I said bluntly.</p>

<p>She stood up with an opposing air of
surprise and alarm. But I was not to
be deceived.</p>

<p>"Your assumed name, Eliza Smudge,"
I said, "gave you away at the start. And
that hair&mdash;it is the tail of your nephew's
rocking-horse, isn't it? And&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But she had fled from the room and
was scudding down the drive, heedless
of my cries of "Brenda, you idiot, come
back!"</p>

<hr />

<p>As I watched from the front-door
I saw that "Eliza Smudge" had met
another woman in the lane and had
engaged her in conversation.</p>

<p>Then they parted, and the other
woman came in at the gate and up the
drive.</p>

<p>"My dear Elfrida," said a well-known
voice, "what have you been up to?
You seem to have thoroughly upset
that nice woman who was with the
Copplestones so long. She told me you
were a very strange lady; in fact she
thought you must be suffering from a
nervous breakdown."</p>

<p>I leaned for support against the
door-post, feeling a little faint.</p>

<p>"Brenda? You?" I gasped. "I
thought&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Such a splendid maid she is,"
Brenda went on. "You'll never find
her equal if you try for ten years."</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page262" id="page262"></a>[pg 262]</span><h2>AT THE PLAY.</h2>

<p class="center">"<span class="sc">Uncle Ned.</span>"</p>

<p>As the final curtain fell on the Fourth
Act there was talk of celebrating the
conversion of the villain in a bottle of
the best (1906). But this did not mean
that the good wine of the play had been
kept to the end. Indeed it had been
practically exhausted about the middle
of the Third Act, and the rest was barley-water,
sweet but relatively insipid.
So long as Mr. <span class="sc">Henry Ainley</span> was just
allowed to sparkle, with beaded bubbles
winking all round the brim of him,
everything went well and more than
well; the trouble began when the
author, Mr. <span class="sc">Douglas Murray</span>, remembered
that no British audience would
be contented with mere irresponsible
badinage, however fresh and delicate;
that somehow he must provide an ending
where virtue prevailed and sentiment
was satisfied.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:40%;"><a href="images/262.png"><img width="100%" src="images/262.png" alt="" /></a><p><i>Sir Robert Graham</i> (<i>Mr. <span class="sc">Randle Ayrton</span></i>).
"<span class="sc">Make yourself at home. Don't mind me.</span>"</p>

<p><i>Edward Graham</i> (<i>Mr. <span class="sc">Henry Ainley</span></i>). "<span class="sc">I
don't.</span>"</p></div>

<p>So, when <i>Uncle Ned's</i> humour had
failed to move the brutal egoism of his
brother, beating upon it like the lightest
of sea-foam on a rock of basalt, he
was made to fall back upon the alternative
of heavy denunciation. And it was
significant that this commonplace tirade
drew more applause than all the pretty
wit that had gone before it. Seldom
have I been so profoundly impressed
with the difficulties of an art which
depends for its success (financial, that
is to say) on the satisfaction of tastes
that have nothing in common beyond
the crudest elements of human nature.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">Ainley</span> had things all his own
way. Between him, the romancer of the
light heart and the free fancy, and
his brother, the millionaire tradesman
of the tough hide, there was the clash
of temperaments but never the clash of
intellects. ("Nobody with a sense of
humour," says <i>Uncle Ned</i>, "ever made
a million pounds.") That the man with
the iron will should be beaten at the
last with his own weapons, and brought
to see the lifelong error of his ways by
a violent philippic that must have surprised
the speaker hardly less than his
audience, was the most incredible thing
in the play. Indeed the author was
reduced to showing us the results of the
bad man's change of heart and leaving
us to imagine the processes, these being
worked out in the interval between two
Acts by means of a fortnight's physical
collapse, from which he emerges
unrecognisably reformed.</p>

<p>I cannot praise too warmly the delightfully
fantastic and inconsequent
humour of the first half of the play.
Often it was the things that Mr. <span class="sc">Ainley</span>
was given to say; but even more often,
I think, it was the incomparable way
he said them, with those astonishingly
swift and unforeseen turns of gesture
and glance and movement which are
his peculiar gift. Now and then, to remind
us of his versatility, he may turn
to sentiment or even tragedy, but light
comedy remains his natural <i>m&eacute;tier</i>.</p>

<p>If I have a complaint to make it is
that <i>Uncle Ned's</i> studied refusal to
understand from an intimate woman-friend
why it was that his elder niece,
who had been privily married, "could
no longer hide her secret" (the reticence
of his friend was the sort of silly thing
that you get in books and plays, but
never in life) was perhaps a little
wanton and caused needless embarrassment
both to the young wife and to us.
And one need not be very squeamish to
feel that it was a pity to put into the
lips of a mere child, a younger sister,
the rather precocious comment that she
makes on the inconvenience of a secret
marriage. The humour of the play
was too good to need assistance from
this sort of titillation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">Randle Ayrton</span>, as the plutocratic
pachyderm, kept up his thankless
end with a fine imperviousness; and
Miss <span class="sc">Irene Rooke</span>, in the part of his
secretary, played, as always, with a very
gracious serenity, though I wish this
charming actress would pronounce her
words with not quite so nice a precision.
Miss <span class="sc">Edna Best</span> was an admirable
flapper, with just the right note
of <i>gaucherie</i>.</p>

<p>As <i>Mears</i>, Mr. <span class="sc">Claude Rains</span> was not
to be hampered by the methods dear to
the detective of convention; he looked
like an apache and behaved, rather
effectively, like nothing in particular.</p>

<p>The <i>Dawkins</i> of Mr. <span class="sc">G. W. Anson</span> knew
well the first duty of a stage-butler, to
keep coming on whenever a stop-gap
is wanted; but he had also great personal
qualities, to say nothing of his
astounding record of forty years' service
in a house where strong liquor
was only permitted for "medicinal"
purposes.</p>

<p>O. S.</p>

<br />

<p class="center">"<span class="sc">The Young Person in Pink.</span>"</p>

<p>What the chair-man said about <i>The
Young Person in Pink</i> who had been
hanging about the Park every morning
for a week was that nowadays you
couldn't really tell. He thought on the
whole she was all right. The balloon-woman
was certain that with boots
like that she must be a 'ussy; but then
she had refused to buy a balloon. As
a matter of fact she couldn't, being
broke to the world. And worse. For
she had arrived at Victoria Station unable
to remember who she was or where
she came from, ticketless, a few shillings
in her purse. She had murmured
"Season" at the barrier and had taken
rooms at the Carlton because she had
a queer feeling she had been there before.
Her things had a coronet on
them. The rest was a blank.</p>

<p>Of course nobody believed her; the
women were scornful, the men not quite
nice, till very young <i>Lord Stevenage</i>,
the one that was engaged to a notorious
baby-snatcher, <i>Lady Tonbridge</i>&mdash;in
a high fever he'd unfortunately said
"Yes"&mdash;meets her, and you guess the
rest. No, you don't. You couldn't
possibly guess <i>Mrs. Badger</i>, relict of an
undertaker and now in the old-clothes
line, who has social ambitions. (I must
here say in parenthesis that <i>Mrs. Badger</i>
is a double stroke of genius on the part
both of Miss <span class="sc">Jennings</span> the author and
of Miss <span class="sc">Sydney Fairbrother</span>. You
don't know which to admire most, the
things she says [Miss J.] or the way
she says them [Miss S. B.]. Honours
divided and high honours at that.)</p>

<p><i>Lady Tonbridge</i> had advertised for a
clergyman's widow to render some
secretarial service, and the ambitious
<i>Mrs. Badger</i> had applied, duly weeded.
Meanwhile the elderly <i>Lady T.</i> had
seen her <i>fianc&eacute;</i> and with the young
person in pink, and it was a brilliant
and base afterthought to bribe the
clergyman's widow to claim the girl as
her long-missing daughter (invented).
Both the young Lord and the young
person, too much in love perhaps to be
critical, accept the situation; but you
haven't quite got <i>Mrs. Badger</i> if you
think she's the sort of person one
would precisely jump at for a mother-in-law.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page263" id="page263"></a>[pg 263]</span><p>At the supreme moment when <i>Mrs. B.</i>,
after an interview with the whisky
bottle, forgets her part and, lapsing into
the mere widow of the undertaker, gives
it to the intriguing <i>Lady Tonbridge</i> in
the neck with a wealth of imagery, a
command of slightly slurred invective
and a range of facial expression beyond
adequate description, she is perhaps
less attractive in the capacity of mother-by-marriage
than ever, even if the interlude
prove the goodness of her heart.
But it is just at that moment that the
young person is recognised by her maid.
The daughter of the <i>Duchess of Hampshire</i>,
no less! So all is well.</p>

<p>Not that Miss <span class="sc">Jennings'</span> plot matters.
She freely accepts the absurdities which
her bizarre outline demands, but doesn't
shirk the pains to make her situations
possible within the pleasantly impossible
frame. What is all-important is
that she does shake the house with
genuinely explosive humour.</p>

<p>If they were Miss <span class="sc">Jennings'</span> bombs,
Miss <span class="sc">Fairbrother</span> threw the most and
the best of them with a perfect aim. The
rest of the platoon helped in varying
degrees. I hope I don't irretrievably
damage Miss <span class="sc">Joyce Carey's</span> reputation
as a modern when I say that she looked
so pretty and innocent that I don't believe
even sour old spinsters would have
doubted her. A charming and capable
performance. Mr. <span class="sc">Donald Calthrop</span>
made love quite admirably on the lighter
note; a little awkwardly, perhaps, on
the more serious. Miss <span class="sc">Sybil Carlisle</span>
handled an unpromising part with great
skill. Miss <span class="sc">Ellis Jeffreys</span> as the ineffable
<i>Lady Tonbridge</i> was as competent
as ever, and had a coat and skirt
in the Third Act which filled the female
breast with envy. Looks like a long run.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Advantages Enjoyed by Cambridge.</span></p>

<p>In complimenting the Light Blues
we cannot help calling attention to two
curious facts which may have contributed
to their victory, and seem to
have escaped the notice of the Oxford
crew. According to <i>The Weekly Dispatch</i>
Mr. <span class="sc">Swann</span> rowed "No. 9 in the
Cambridge boat"; and a photograph
in <i>The Illustrated Sunday Herald</i>
("the camera cannot lie") distinctly
shows the Cambridge crew rowing with
as many as eight oars on the stroke
side. How many they were using on
the bow side is not revealed.</p>

<p>Even the serious condition of Joe Batt's
Arm hardly interests us so much as
the challenge to the world's humourists
implied in the Committee's selection of
their secretary.</p>

<hr />

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page264" id="page264"></a>[pg 264]</span><h2>MY ONE ADMIRER.</h2>

<p>Of course my wife had made me go
to the bazaar. All men go to bazaars
either because their wives send them,
or in search of possible wives. The
men who are never at bazaars are
those with humane wives, or the true
bachelors.</p>

<p>I did not mind the young lady who
grabbed my walking-stick and presented
me with a shilling cloakroom ticket,
or the other who placed a buttonhole
in my coat (two-and-sixpence), or the
third who sprayed me with scent (one
shilling, but had I known of the
threatened attack I would have paid
two shillings for immunity), or the
fourth, who snatched my rather elderly
silk hat and renovated it, not before its
time, with some mysterious fluid (one-and-ninepence).
These are the things
one expects.</p>

<p>But when I faced the stalls I must
admit that I trembled. In pre-war
days it was occasionally hinted that
bazaar prices were a trifle high. What
would they be now? How could I face
the Bazaar profiteer? Sums, reminding
me of schooldays, ran in my head, "If
milk be a shilling a quart what will be
the price of a sofa-cushion?"</p>

<p>As I stood in the centre of the hall
I could see that the eyes of the stall-holders
were upon me&mdash;cold, horrid,
calculating eyes. I could read in them,
"How much has this man got?" I
felt that it would be a proper punishment
for war-profiteers if they were
sentenced to purchase all their requirements
at bazaars for six months.</p>

<p>Glancing round the hall in search
of a place of refuge I saw a sign,
"Autograph Exhibition&mdash;Admission one
shilling." A shilling! Why, such a
comfortable hiding-place would have
been cheap at half-a-crown. I bolted
for the Autograph Exhibition before a
piratical lady, bearing down on me
with velvet smoking caps, could reduce
me to pulp.</p>

<p>A smiling elderly gentleman was
in charge. "Hah, you would like to
see my little collection? Certainly,
certainly."</p>

<p>I am not interested in autographs.
Most bygone celebrities wrote undecipherable
hands. I have been equally
puzzled in trying to read the handwriting
of <span class="sc">Guy Fawkes</span> and Mr.
<span class="sc">Gladstone</span>. But this collection was
different. It had letters from nearly
every one distinguished in the world
to-day&mdash;good, lengthy, interesting,
readable letters.</p>

<p>"How did you contrive to get all
these?" I asked the exhibitor.</p>

<p>"Tact, foresight and flattery, my
dear Sir. It would be no use writing
to these people to-day. You'd get
ignored, or at best two lines type-written
by a secretary. Now look at
that long letter from <span class="sc">Lloyd George</span>
about Welsh nationality and that other
from <span class="sc">Hilaire Belloc</span> concerning the
adulteration of modern beer. You
couldn't get them now. My idea is to
catch your celebrity young. When a
man produces his first play or novel
or book of poems I write him an admiring
letter. You can't lay it on too
thick. Ask him some question on a
topic that interests him. It always
draws. They are unused to praise and
you catch them before the public has
spoilt them. I card-index all the
replies I get. Of course nine out of
ten of the people turn out of no
account, but some are sure to come off.
You just throw out the failures and
put the successes in your collection."</p>

<p>At this point I heard our Archdeacon
afar off. Our Archdeacon booms&mdash;not
like trade, but like the bittern. I heard
him booming outside, "My dear lady,
I cannot miss the chance of seeing dear
Mr. Fletterby's collection."</p>

<p>Fletterby! The name was familiar.
Long years ago I published something&mdash;don't
inquire into the details of my
crime&mdash;and the sole response I had
from an unappreciative world was a
highly eulogistic letter from one Samuel
Fletterby. I remembered the time I
had spent in writing him a lengthy and
courteous reply. I remembered that
often in my darker days I had drawn
out the letter of Fletterby to encourage
me.</p>

<p>And now! I looked at the collection.
It was arranged alphabetically. As
I turned to the initial of my name I
framed a dramatic revelation for my
friend Fletterby: "That writing is
familiar to me. In fact, Mr. Fletterby,
I am its unworthy writer."</p>

<p>But my letter was not included in
the collection.</p>

<p>"Throw out the failures," Mr. Fletterby
had said.</p>

<p>I threw myself out instantly from
the Autograph Exhibition. Better, far
better buy things I didn't want at
prices I couldn't afford than stay in the
company of that faithless one, my sole
erstwhile (as the papers say) admirer.</p>

<h2>EASTER IN WILD WALES.</h2>

<p>The recent discovery (duly noted in
<i>The Daily Graphic</i> of the 30th ult.) of
"seven pearls of excellent quality" by
an Aberavon labourer in a mussel
stranded by the tide has led to an
extraordinary influx of visitors to that
quiet seaside resort. Costers have been
arriving at the rate of several hundreds
a day, attracted by the prospect of
finding the raw materials for the indispensable
decoration of their costumes,
and the local authorities are at their
wits' end to provide adequate accommodation.
Amongst the latest arrivals
is the great architect, Sir <span class="sc">Martin Conway</span>,
who has been consulted with
regard to the erection of a number of
bungalow skyscrapers, and an urgent
message has been despatched to Sir
<span class="sc">Edwin Lutyens</span> at Delhi, begging him
to supply designs of a suitable character.
Meanwhile pearl-diving goes on day and
night on the sea-front, with the assistance
of a flock of oyster-catchers, whose
brilliant plumage adds greatly to the
picturesqueness of the scene.</p>

<p>Though the special good fortune of
Aberavon has excited a certain amount
of natural jealousy in the breasts of
hotel and boarding-house proprietors at
other Welsh seaside resorts, they have
no serious reason to complain. The
usual attractions of Barmouth have
been powerfully reinforced by the presence
in the neighbouring hills of a
full-sized gorilla which recently escaped
from a travelling menagerie. When
last seen the animal was making in the
direction of Harlech, which is at present
the head-quarters of the Easter Vacation
School of the Cambrian section of
the Yugo-Slav Doukhobors. It is understood
that the local police have the
matter well in hand, and arrangements
have been made, in case of emergency,
for withdrawing all the population
within the precincts of the castle.</p>

<p>Great disappointment prevails at
Llandudno owing to the refusal of Mr.
<span class="sc">Evan Roberts</span>, the famous revivalist,
to localise the materialisation of the
Millennium, which he has recently
prophesied, at Llandudno during the
Easter holidays. By way of a set-off
an effort was made to induce Sir
<span class="sc">Auckland Geddes</span> to give a vocal recital
before his departure for America.
As his recent performance at a meeting
of the London Scots Club proved, Sir
<span class="sc">Auckland</span> is a singist of remarkable
power, infinite humour and soul-shaking
pathos. Unfortunately his repertory is
confined to Scottish songs, and on this
ground he has been obliged to decline
the invitation, though the fee offered
was unprecedented in the economic
annals of the variety stage.</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.</i>)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">Forrest Reid</span> is a writer upon whose progress I have
for some time kept an appreciative eye. His latest story,
bearing the attractive title of <i>Pirates of the Spring</i> (<span class="sc">Unwin</span>),
proves, I think, that progress to be well sustained. As
you may have guessed from the name, this is a tale of
adolescence; it shows Mr. <span class="sc">Reid's</span> North-Ireland lads differing
slightly from the more familiar home-product, though
less in essentials than in tricks of speech, and (since these
are day-school boys, exposed to the influence of their several
homes) an echo of religious conflict happily rare in the
experience of English youth. Mr. <span class="sc">Reid</span> is amongst the
few novelists who can be sympathetic to boyhood without
sentimentalising over it; he has admirably caught its strange
mingling of pride and curiosity, of reticence and romance
and jealous loyalty. The tale has no particular plot; it is
a record of seeming trifles, friendships made and broken and
renewed, sporadic adventures and deep-laid intrigues that
lead nowhere. But you will catch in it a real air of youth,
a spring-time wind blowing from the half-forgotten world
in which all of us once were chartered privateers. There
are, of course, worthy folk who would be simply bored
by all this&mdash;which is why I do not venture to call
<i>Pirates of the Spring</i> everyone's reading; others, however,
more fortunate, will find it a true and delicately observed
study of an engaging theme.</p>

<hr />

<p>I must really warn the flippant. It would be appalling if
admirers of <i>Literary</i> (and other) <i>Lapses</i> were to send blithely
to the libraries for Mr. <span class="sc">Leacock's</span> latest and find themselves
landed with <i>The Unsolved Riddle of Social Justice</i>
(<span class="sc">Lane</span>). And yet I don't know. Here is a subject which
even the flippant cannot long ignore. And a man of the
world with a clear head and a mastery of clearer idiom than
a professor of political economy usually commands has
here said something desperately serious without a trace of
dulness. I should like Professor <span class="sc">Leacock's</span> short book to
be divided into three. The first part, a trenchant analysis
of some of the evils of our social and industrial system,
I would send to the impossibilists and obstructives; the
second, a critical examination of some of the nostrums of
the progressives, should go to the hasty optimists who
think that a sudden change of system will as suddenly
change men, for it contains much that they will do well
(and now resolutely refuse) to ponder. The third part I
would return to the author for revision, for it contains no
more, when analysed, than an <i>ipse dixit</i>, and quite fails to
show that the evils denounced as intolerable in the first
part can be remedied without some substantial portion at
least of the heroic reforms denounced in his second. Also
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page266" id="page266"></a>[pg 266]</span>I would remind him, or rather perhaps the more ingenuous
of his readers, that there have been later contributions to
the theory and practice of new-world building than Mr.
<span class="sc">Bellamy's</span> <i>Looking Backward</i>.</p>

<hr />

<p><i>The Great Desire</i> (<span class="sc">Hodder and Stoughton</span>) is a novel full
of shrewd philosophy and excellent talk. Mr. <span class="sc">Alexander
Black</span> sets out to prove nothing, to justify no political or
social attitude, but just to draw his fellow-Americans as he
sees them going about their war-time business, the "great
desire" being simply the thing that is uppermost in the
mind of each one. As a composite picture of what New
York thought about the business
of getting into the War
the result could hardly be
bettered. One never feels
that latent antagonism which
readers, even though they
may agree with him, unconsciously
experience towards
an author who seems to be
arguing a point. Mr. <span class="sc">Black</span>
gives the extreme views of the
blatant patriot, and of the
anarchist and socialist who
cannot see the distinction
between arguing against war
on paper and arguing against
this War on the street corner.
He makes us realise the people
who think only how to
make the War an adjunct of
themselves and those who desire
only to make themselves
a useful adjunct of the War.
He draws his types cleverly
and states the case of each one
fairly, but with a humorous
restraint and from a standpoint
of absolute detachment.
<i>The Great Desire</i> has plenty
of charm regarded merely as a
story, but I recommend it
especially to those who are
apt to judge the Americans
by their politicians or to assess
New York on the basis of the
<span class="sc">Hearst</span> newspapers.</p>

<hr />

<p>If it were only for his complete
fearlessness in following
well-worn convention and
his apparent reliance on his
readers' ignorance or want of memory, Mr. <span class="sc">J. Murray
Gibbon's</span> <i>Drums Afar</i> (<span class="sc">Lane</span>) would be rather a remarkable
book in these psycho-analytical days. His hero actually
has the audacity to have blue eyes and fair hair, to start
his career in the House, and to end it, so far as the novel
is concerned, lying wounded in a hospital, where his <i>fianc&eacute;e</i>,
a famous singer, happened to be a nurse in the same ward.
Nor does the young man disdain the threadbare conversational
<i>clich&eacute;</i>. "Don't you think there is something
elemental in most of us which no veneer of civilisation or
artificial living can ever deaden?" he says in one place
(rather as if veneer were a kind of rat poison). Still bolder,
on leaving America, where he has become engaged to a
wealthy Chicagan's daughter, he quotes&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"I could not love thee, dear, so much</p>
<p class="i6">Loved I not honour more."</p>
</div> </div>

<p>And, although the girl is annoyed, it is not on account of
the citation. Much of the story, however, deals with Chicago,
and since my previous knowledge of that city could have
easily been contained in a tin of pressed beef I can pardon
Mr. <span class="sc">Gibbon</span> for being as informative about it as he is about
Oxford colleges. (He seems, by the way, to have a rooted
contempt for Balliol, which I had always supposed was a
quite well-meaning place.) On the whole, either in spite
or because of its rather Baedeker-like qualities, <i>Drums Afar</i>
will be found quite a restful and readable book.</p>

<hr />

<p>Somewhere in the course of the tale that gives its title to
<i>The Blower of Bubbles</i> (<span class="sc">Chambers</span>)
the character who is
supposed to relate it denies
that he is a sentimentalist.
I may as well say at once
that, if this denial is intended
to apply also to Mr. <span class="sc">Arthur
Beverley Baxter</span>, who
wrote the five stories that
make up the volume, a more
comprehensive misstatement
was never embodied in print.
Because, from the picture on
the wrapper, representing a
starry-eyed infant conducting
an imaginary orchestra, to
the final page, the book is
one riot of sentiment&mdash;plots,
characters and treatment
alike. Not that, save by the
fastidious, it must be considered
any the worse for
this; even had not Mr. <span class="sc">Baxter's</span>
hearty little preface
explained the conditions of
active service under which it
was composed, themselves
enough to excuse any quantity
of over-sweetening. I
will not give you the five
long-shorts in detail. The
first, about a German child
and a young man with heart
trouble, shows Mr. <span class="sc">Baxter</span> at
his worst, with the sob-stuff
all but overwhelming a sufficiently
nimble wit. My own
favourite is the fifth tale, a
spirited and generous tribute
to England's war effort. (I
should explain that the book,
and I suppose the author also, is by origin Canadian.)
This last story, told partly in the form of letters to his
editor in New York by an American officer and journalist,
has all the interest that comes of seeing ourselves as others
see us; though I could not but think that the narrator
erred in making the haughty <i>Lady Dorothy</i>, daughter of
his noble hosts, exclaim, on the entrance of a footman with
a letter, "Pardon me, it's the mail." So there you are.
If you have a taste for stories that make no pretence of
being other than fiction pure and simple, limpidly pure
and transparently simple (yet witty too in places), try
these; otherwise pass.</p>
